This is an app to manage resident needs and coordinate volunteers.  We have created this app to facilitate the disaster relief and rebuild process in direct response to the destruction caused by Hurricane Sandy.  As long time New Yorkers, we are committed to the recovery of New York's waterfront and surrounding shoreline area.
